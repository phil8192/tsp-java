Travelling salesman problem
---------------------------
Implemnetation of Approximate Local Search for the TSP.

This is is an implementation of Jon Bentley's 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley) 2-Opt search for the TSP with "dont 
look bits". I aim for this (java) implementation to be as efficient as 
possible).

Originally, this was as an implementation of GLS: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_Local_Search

However..
GLS requires a matrix to store (N^2-N)/2 edge penalties which is O(N^2) for N 
cities. As such, GLS is limited to instances <= sqrt((8*1024*1024*1024*8)/32) 
= 46,340 cities on a machine with 8G free memory.

For now, this is the FLS (Fast Local Search) component of GLS (with 
improvements.) which is actually a first improvement (as opposed to greedy) 
version of the approximate 2-Opt heuristic described by Bentley^. See 
http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.4.4.387

test:
-----
tour of 9,882 cities in greece. known optimal = 300,899.

```bash
phil@Eris:~/tsp$ ./run.sh data/gr9882.tsp /tmp/points.out
tour length = 340852.95 optimisation time = 2.84 seconds.
phil@Eris:~/tsp$ ./post-process.sh /tmp/points.out
phil@Eris:~/tsp$ convert /tmp/out.png -flip /tmp/out-flip.png
phil@Eris:~/tsp$ convert /tmp/out-flip.png -rotate -90 out.png
```

notes
-----
* GLS, due to its dependency on distance matrix and penalty matrix is not 
  capable of searching large problems. should look at alternative ways to store 
  penalty term. pheramone? actually, the GLS algorithm seems to assume an 
  infinite penalty matrix = to the distance matrix. it is easy to get rid of 
  the distance matrix, as in this code. however the GLS penalty matrix must 
  persist: GLS lets FLS do all of the work, then penalises. GLS also claims 
  that the implementation details of the underlying local search algorithm do
  not mater. however, this is not the case, since GLS relies on a distance 
  matrix which is "augmented".    
* checking if ab < ac && cd < bd in moveCost(...) before doing the 4 sqrt()s is
  a massive performance gain. tried an LRU cache for distances, inlining lots 
  of code, precomputing sqrts: with little improvement.
